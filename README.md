# README

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and it [deploys automatically to GitHub pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages). 

I referenced [SafdarJamal's quiz-app](https://github.com/SafdarJamal/quiz-app) and [this Codevertiser article](https://www.codevertiser.com/quiz-app-using-reactjs/) for examples of quizzes in React. 

The answers are in `quiz_data.json`. I didn't bother trying to make the key secret because this is just for fun.
